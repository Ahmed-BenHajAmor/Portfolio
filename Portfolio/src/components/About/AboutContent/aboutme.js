    text: 'I am a self-taught React developer, embarking on my coding journey in March 2021. Leveraging YouTube as my primary learning platform, I have honed my skills and gained proficiency in React development. Beyond my individual pursuits, I actively contribute to two prominent international organizations: JCI (Junior Chamber International) and GDSC (Google Developer Student Club). Within JCI, I serve as a dedicated member on the Media, Internal Relations, and Fundraising committees, bringing a multifaceted approach to my involvement. This diverse experience not only showcases my technical capabilities but also underscores my commitment to community engagement and collaborative initiatives.'
