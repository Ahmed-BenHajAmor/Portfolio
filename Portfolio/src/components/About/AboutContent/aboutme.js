    text: "I’m a self-taught web enthusiast who began exploring web development in March 2021. Through platforms like YouTube and hands-on projects, I’ve built a strong foundation in front-end technologies and continue to expand my skills across the web stack.\n\nOutside of tech, I actively contribute to JCI , GDG FST and Securinets, where I’ve developed strong teamwork, communication, and leadership abilities. I'm currently looking for a web development internship where I can learn from experienced teams, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a developer."
